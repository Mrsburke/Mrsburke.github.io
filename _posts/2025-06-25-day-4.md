what_i_learned: |
  Today is all about preparation for tomorrow's Mid-Summer Symposium.

blockers: |
  The biggest challenges are time and making sure all programs are running efficiently.
reflection: |
  My input comes in after everyone is completed...editing the slides.  Just making sure everything looks uniform and consistent.  Our team is on full intense mode, ironing out all of the details and running programs for efficiency.  D-Fliers are making it happen!
