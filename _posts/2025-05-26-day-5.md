what_i_learned: |
  Today I am attempting Github independently for the first time this week.  I've been leaning on my students to guide me and now I am attenpting my independent practice. 

  I also implemented a basic bandpass filter to isolate frequencies between 8–12Hz, which are useful for emotion-related tasks. Additionally, I learned how artifacts like eye blinks and jaw clenching can interfere with clean EEG analysis.

blockers: |
  I had to change my mindset.  The shift has to happen within before it can be executed.  
reflection: |
  As I gave myself grace this week with myself, I have to remember this with my students.  There shifts may occur a little later than when I expect, but I have to remain patient with the process.
