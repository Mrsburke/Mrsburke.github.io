what_i_learned: |
  Today was my first introduction to Zotero. This is also my second go at posting this blog.
blockers: |
  Time management and patience with myself

reflection: |
  I am currently sifting through approximately 60 + articles for the literature review. We've decided my area of expertise will remain with editing.  Little do they know, I hired an editor for action research and this is all new to me...lit not litty!
