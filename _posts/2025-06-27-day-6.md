what_i_learned: |
  I can learn to take interest in a subject I had no prior knowledge of.

blockers: |
  Go outside of my comfort zone and learn something new!

reflection: |
  I chose this group project based on what I teach students about the history of flight, its' pioneers, innovation, and how planes take flight.
  I have basic knowledge of AI, however looking at what is behind the scenes in the development of Artificial Intelligence is another side.  Students are working on this project extracting mass amounts of data in order to create AI that detects patterns of climate and weather in order to make predictions of flight scheduling.  The data mining is incredible.  In order to create algorithms (if this is correctly stated), they are using mass data bases and sifting through...this takes lots of time!  I have a high level of respect for all of this team in how they are diligent, focused, and committed to creating this model.  I am the clear mentee in this room!
