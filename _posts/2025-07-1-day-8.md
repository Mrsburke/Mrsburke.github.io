  Trying not to get emotional in front of them...FAILED!

reflection: |
  Today's exercise was about cheerleading for ourselves.  After working with my group, I am seeing how much pressure they are feeling. Getting ready for the mid-summer symposium has nerves and expectations really high, so I wanted to do something to calm them down and remember how great they are. We started off giving each other grows and glows, highlighting appreciated moments from each other.  Afterwards, I gave an assignment of writing a letter to our younger selves (1, 5, or 10 years ago). In this letter, we wrote letting our younger selves know what we've done to get to this very day...our accomplishments, obstacles, or anything that we wanted to share. Some of our greatest strength comes from our personal truth, but often times, we forget this...too busy, too tired, too scared. Their responses were absolutely the most heartfelt and authentic.  I had to hold back serious tears listening to their letters, because they really took down their veils and shared their personal journies. I wanted them to remember how far they've come and what they had to overcome to be here, as well as seeing their goup partners through another lens. By the end of the letters, I think they developed a new appreciation for each other, and an understanding how they are each a perfect piece of this great puzzle. The exercise ended with an online musical game with suno.com.  This software is a great tool, using AI to create personalized songs. Everyone created a song to share...in the words of MJB, they will be 'Just Fine!'
