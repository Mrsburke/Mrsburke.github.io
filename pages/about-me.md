  bio: |
    Currently, I teach Foundations of Technology at Long Reach High School in Howard County Schools. This is year 25 as a teacher, but my 2nd year as the Technology teacher.  

    I am also a visual artist and a professional winemaker.  This role gives me the chance to bring my creative expertise to students at Morgan, while learning about Artificial Intelligence.  My goal is to bring my newly acquired skillset to my high school classroom.
